I'm migrating my blog into github pages! It's been years since all my notes is scattered aroung and I'm too buzy/lazy to open my wordpress backend for blogging. I write article in medium, linkedin, occationally, but it's time to collect all and put it here.

I found that writing notes is markdown is my new habit, recently. I can easily put code snippet and command, and the syntax is really simple, it can easily converted to html, and on top of that, there are many free hosting for static file, like this one.

Many post will coming, from many articles I wrote long time ago. If you are ended up here (I don't know why), then enjoy your stay. Kudos!
