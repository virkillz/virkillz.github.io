I'm blogging again. The reason I'm doing this is mostly for self note. The way I learn usually is to write down in markdown file. It is very convenient way to write note especially as a programmer where we need to put snippet, link, ect.

I heard about the fact that we can host static website at github. I ignore it for quite sometimes until now. I also heard about [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and for quite sometimes I have no idea what is the purpose of 'static site generator'.
